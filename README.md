# vesta.dip.3d.matlab
A general view of my MATLAB codes I use for 3D models. I'll organize this repository in some examples. The first one is the easiest one, using a global map in sphere coordinates (azimuthal the rows, elevation the lines, and the radius or the topography, the height of the images).
